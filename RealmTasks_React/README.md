# RealmTasks - the React Native version

A basic task management app, designed as a homage to Clear.

## Prerequisites

1. meet all the prerequisites to [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) development
2. `npm install`
3. start RealmTasks as a regular React Native app, e.g.

    ./node_modules/.bin/react-native run-ios


By default, the app syncs to the demo server `demo.sync.realmlab.net`.
You may like to use your own install of the [Realm Mobile Platform](https://realm.io/products/realm-mobile-platform/).
Then, edit `config.js` for URLs/IP addresses etc.
